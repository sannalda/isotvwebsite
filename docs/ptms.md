# Phosphorylation Sites

Identifying phosphorylation binding sites is another to understand the functional effects of transcripts.

[ScanProsite](https://prosite.expasy.org/scanprosite/) was used to scan and identify potential phosphorylation binding site motifs.

## Usage

Input - `/Genes/GENE/Transcripts/x_protein.fa`

Output - `/Genes/GENE/Transcripts/x_protein_sites.txt`


## Output Folder Structure

```
| -- Genes/
    | -- GENE/
        | -- Transcripts/
            | -- x_protein_sites.txt
            ...
```
